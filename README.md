## Motivation

A package that keeps all the settings for great tools in one place, making my TypeScript React development much easier and better, just for me.

## Support Tools

- [Biome](https://github.com/biomejs/biome) v.1.9.4

## Memo

### Policy

- For language specifications, we will complement it in a form that does not omit anything that can be omitted.

### Code Style

- Biome's `javascript.formatter.arrowParentheses` is set to `"always"`.
- Biome's `javascript.formatter.quoteProperties` is set to `"asNeeded"`.
- Biome's `javascript.formatter.semicolons` is set to `"always"`.
- Biome's `javascript.formatter.trailingCommas` is set to `"all"`.
- Biome's `javascript.formatter.indentStyle` is set to `"space"`.
- Biome's `javascript.formatter.indentWidth` is set to `2`.
- Biome's `organizeImports` is not used. Instead, sorting is done with ESLint.
