Your goal is to update the documentation file

- The documentation files are in GitHub Flavor Markdown format.
- The documentation is organized into different files, each corresponding to a specific topic or feature of the project.
- Check [eslint.config.js](../../configs/eslint/eslint.config.js) and document the details of any explicitly modified rules in `eslint.md`.
- If new eslint plugin dependencies are added to the project, update the "Policy" section in the relevant documentation files to list and describe these new dependencies.
